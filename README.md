## Program  
The program is a extended project version built for Unit COS10009 at Swinburne University.
It is a music player that demonstrates the ability to render music album and art covers witha txt file.
The ability to play music is only shown through a console display as wasn't able to get Gosu.Song to work.
Ignore any commented out code as this was used for testing with additional music files and may break the program.
